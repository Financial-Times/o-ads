This is an Origami module that enables display advertising from [Googles DFP Ad server](http://www.google.com/dfp), and provides customised demographic, behavioural (via [Krux](http://www.krux.com/)), and contextual (via [Admantx](http://admantx.com/)) targeting.

### Requirements

Each targeting/tracking supplier will require their own configuration and setup.

### Demos
