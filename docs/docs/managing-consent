# Managing User Consent Options within the FT.com Advertising Stack

## Overview
On FT.com Users are able to opt-in/out of different types of advertising.
Note that currently there is no option to allow users to opt-out of *all* advertising on FT.com. 

There are currently two options available to FT.com users to tailor the types of advertising they will see on FT.com; these are:
  * Demographically Targeted Ads (toggle on/off)
  * Behaviorally Targeted Ads (toggle on/off)

This documentation will detail: 
  * What is meant Demographically targeted ads
  * What is meant by Behaviourally targeted ads
  * How does a user toggle these options on/off
  * What happens within the ft.com tech-stack when these options are toggled on/off


## What is meant by demographically / behaviorally targeted ads?
See the glossary for a general overview of what is meant by 'targeted' advertising. When a page on FT.com makes an ad-request (see glossary, a network request to the ad-server to return an ad-creative). Requests to the ad-server contain key/value pairs in the ad

The advertising stack has been integrated with the `next-control-center` and `next-consent-proxy`
