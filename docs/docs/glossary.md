**TARGETING**  
Criteria to make ad rendering more tailored and precise.  
- _DEMOGRAPHIC_  
References gender, age, income, etc, of a user.   
- _GEOGRAPHIC_  
Shows adverts based on a users physical location (usually determined by the IP address)  
- _BEHAVIOURAL_  
Analyses a users previous decision making behaviour and delivers relevant adverts (e.g. visiting certain areas of a site frequently)  
- _CONTEXTUAL_

**VIEWABILITY**  
Viewability is an online advertising metric that aims to track only impressions that can actually be seen by users. The FT uses a platform called [Moat](https://moat.com/) to enable this.

**VIEWABLE IMPRESSION**  
A digital creative that has the opportunity to be seen, sometimes referred to through the traditional print media term of being “above the fold”. The current industry criteria for a standard ad unit to be considered viewable is that 50% of the canvas was within the consumer’s rendered window for a minimum of 1 second – the time required for a consumer to understand that the unit is a piece of advertising.
