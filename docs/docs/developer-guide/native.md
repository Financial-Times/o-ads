The FT offers the following types of native ad formats:

* **Paid Posts**
Paid Posts are pieces of content paid for and written by an advertiser. The content links off to some content hosted by the advertiser.

* **Special Reports**
Special Reports are actual editorially written content, available in the Content API - but they are sometimes promoted by Advertising.

* **Smartmatch**
Smartmatch is a third-party that provides contextually relevant links to outside content.
