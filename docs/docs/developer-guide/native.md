The FT offers the following types of native ad formats:

* **Paid Posts**  
Paid Posts are pieces of content that have been paid for and written by an advertiser. The content links off to content hosted by the advertiser, and is supported and produced by [FTÂ²](http://aboutus.ft.com/2015/09/28/financial-times-launches-content-marketing-suite-ft%C2%B2/#axzz4MJct5qgS).

* **Special Reports**  
Special Reports are actual editorially written content, available in the Content API - but they are sometimes promoted by Advertising.

* **SmartMatch**  
SmartMatch is a third-party product provided by [Smartology](http://www.smartology.net/about/).  
It provides contextually relevant links to outside content.
