The FT operates on a mixed revenue model, whereby we fund our journalism through both subscriptions and advertising.

This documentation illustrates how advertising works at the FT, and how to integrate advertising in your product.

Our portfolio currently consists of the following types of advertising:

* **Display**: these are the standard IAB format ads (e.g. banners, MPUs)
* **Native**: Advertising in the form of content, and designed to look, feel and behave as though they are part of the product.
* **Video**: Pre-roll advertising on video players
