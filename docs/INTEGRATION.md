# oAds Integration guidelines

Origami modules can be installed via two options:

## Origami Build Service
[Origami build service](http://build.origami.ft.com/v2/) - Ideally used on the websites, this way you can get updates automatically and you do not have to build the module manually from source

## Origami Build Tools
[Origami build tools](http://origami.ft.com/docs/developer-guide/building-modules/) - Using this option you may include the library as a part of your codebase and build it manually, involves a certain level of setup.

### Extra step for FT teams
Please feed back the following information to the Dev Test and Advertising team:
# Where do you integrate it (Site, URL?)
# How are you using it (Build service or Manual Build)
# Version you are using (do you use a specific version and is there auto upgrade link, e.g. http://semver.org/ , patch only, version only , etc.)
